# Welcome to Lencof/Cryptography_Python

``cryptography`` includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, 
message digests, and key derivation functions. For example, to encrypt something with ``cryptography``’s high level symmetric encryption recipe:

Go to file ``Crypto.py``


# Installation
You can install ``cryptography`` with ``pip``:

``$ pip install cryptography``

``$ pip install requests``

``$ pip install socket``


# Layout

``cryptography`` is broadly divided into two levels. One with safe cryptographic recipes that require little to no configuration choices. These are safe and easy to use and don’t require developers to make many decisions.

The other level is low-level cryptographic primitives. They are often dangerous and can be misused. They require decision making and deep knowledge of current cryptographic concepts. Because of the potential hazard when operating at this level, it is referred to as the “hazardous material” or “hazardous material” layer.

We recommend using the recipe layer and returning to it whenever possible
